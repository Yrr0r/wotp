The close button is only useful if this page is opened from a script. 

Usage:
Put key table as a query string like this behind the URL:

?k=
QueryName1,key1;
QueryName2,key2,o:v;
QueryName3,key3,o:v,o:v,o:v;
&t=timestamp

k is the string storing the list of all credentials, t is the freezed timestamp. 

Setting the k is all you need:
- QueryName is the name you give to each password. Required field.
- key is the secret key. Required field.
- "o:v" means options:value pair. Omit them if you don't need. Refer to 'Custom options'.

t is the set freezed timestamp. Omit this whole line if you don't need. More info at the end. 

Here is an simple example of only one password:
?k=TestMFA,JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP
You can paste this line after the current URL and see it work.

Attention on Formatting:
Semicolons only needed if you use more than one password.
Do not leave empty semicolons(;). Abide the format strictly to avoid parse errors.
Do not put spaces and non-alphanumerical values in the QueryName except for '-' and '_'. 
Carriage return and spaces are only for readability here. Do not put them in.

Custom options:
d: digits (6)
a: algorithm (sha-1)
p: period (30 sec)
Write in the format of 'options:value', i.e. "d:8".

Freezed timestamp:
This variable is an integer of seconds passed from Unix Epoch. 
The program defaults to current time. 
You only need to set this if you want to see the password from past or future.
